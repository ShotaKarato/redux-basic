# Understanding Redux

This repo is based on this excellent lecture of Redux.  
[[Redux]-The Best Explanation of How it Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sjMRS1gJys&list=PPSV)

During the lecture, Stephen explains the concept of Redux with an insurance company analogy.

The code here added a few more touches to what he covers during the lecture. I did so by re-implementing it with TypeScript and prepared a simple test for action creators and reducers.
